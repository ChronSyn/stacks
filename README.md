> Build React Native views blazingly fast.

## Motivation

Disclaimer: **Stacks** is not yet another full design system.

[Max Stoiber](https://github.com/mxstbr) has recently written an interesting [article](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin) about why margin is considered harmful. There are three main disadvantages of using margin:

- margin breaks component encapsulation
- margin makes reusability harder
- margin conflicts with how designers think

I fully agree with this point of view. To me, it's obvious that handling margins across the entire project is simply difficult and might be not scalable. For web projects, a design system called [Braid](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/foundations/layout) has developer-friendly API for building layouts. However, a similar library was missing for React Native based projects. Therefore, **Stacks** has been created and it adopts Braid Layouts API with subtle differences.

## Getting started

### Installation

```shell
yarn add @mobily/stacks
```

or with `npm`

```shell
npm install @mobily/stacks --save
```

### Prerequisites

To use **Stacks** properly you need to pass a default spacing value to a `Provider` at the top of your React tree.

```tsx
import { Provider as Stacks } from '@mobily/stacks'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Stacks spacing={4}>
      â€¦
    </Stacks>
  )
}
```
